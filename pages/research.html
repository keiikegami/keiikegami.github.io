<p>(JMP) Kei Ikegami, Bargaining over Leasing Contracts amid Shifting Power Balance (draft coming soon)
    <details>
    <summary>Short Summary</summary>
    This paper investigates the tenant leasing contracts in shopping malls, with a particular focus on controlling the time-varying power balance between the involved parties. Utilizing a novel dataset covering two shopping malls and their tenants over six years—including contract terms, daily sales, and negotiation records—I estimate a structural model to recover the evolution of power balances. The results reveal that the power balance varies over time due to the influence of tenants' past performance, such as sales per unit area. In my simulations, these temporal dynamics account for approximately 10% of the shopping mall's surplus. Based on these estimated power balance, I show that controlling for them allows valid empirical analysis of the contract terms. The selection of contract terms aligns with the risk attitude of the shopping mall manager. And up to twice the amount of rent can be collected by changing the way to pick a contract while keeping the power balance between the tenants fixed.

    <details>
    <summary>Short Summary</summary>
    This paper investigates the efficiency of cap-based regulation within the Japan Residency Matching Program (JRMP) in addressing the geographic distributional imbalances of medical residents across Japan. We develop a theoretical model that extends the classic matching with transferable utility framework to incorporate regional caps and floors as policy constraints. Our model allows for the design of taxation policies that influence equilibrium matching outcomes while respecting these constraints. Using a novel dataset of matching outcomes from 2016 to 2019, we estimate agents' preferences and conduct counterfactual analyses. Our simulation demonstrates that a small monetary intervention and modifying the regional caps could effectively increase the number of residents in rural areas, thereby reducing geographic imbalances.

    <summary>Short Summary</summary>
    We propose a model for joint venture formation in the context of procurement auctions. This model enables us to identify the formation mechanism, which is necessary for simulating counterfactual auction settings. We estimate the model using newly collected Japanese procurement auction data. Our estimates reveal the presence of cost synergies: joint ventures are more likely to be cost-effective compared to standard bidders. Despite this pro-competitive effect, our simulation indicates that excessive encouragement of joint ventures hinders cost-effective procurement by reducing competition. This anti-competitive effect arises from the diminished incentive to enter the auction due to the possibility to compete with joint ventures.

    <details>
    <summary>Short Summary</summary>
    This paper examines the procurement of resources for a subsequent matching market. We present a three-stage model: 1) bilateral bargaining between procurers and resource suppliers, 2) suppliers' decisions on resource provision, and 3) the realization of a stable matching outcome. We adopt the Nash-in-Nash approach as the solution concept for bargaining, revealing a unique equilibrium where procurers are unable to incentivize suppliers, resulting in minimal procurement. However, we demonstrate that by committing to an assignment rule that reverses the order of assignment, the government can increase the number of procured resources in equilibrium. Our findings emphasize the social benefits of integrating the allocation and procurement problems.
