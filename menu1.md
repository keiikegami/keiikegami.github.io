## Working Paper

### Induced Physician-Induced Demand (with [\col{blue}{Ken Onishi}](https://sites.google.com/site/kenonishiecon/), and [\col{blue}{Naoki Wakamori}](https://sites.google.com/site/nwakamori/home))

Physicians may change their practices when introducing advanced medical equipment, and, in particular, they tend to overuse it. We investigate further inefficiency arising from physicians at surrounding hospitals. Using the panel data on the Japanese hospitals, we find that there exists a business-stealing effect: Hospitals lose their patients because of MRI adoption by nearby public hospitals, and, to compensate for the loss of patients, physicians take more MRI scans per patient. Our results suggest that the decision to adopt medical equipment needs to be made collectively rather than individually to avoid not only excessive adoption but also further physician-induced demand.
